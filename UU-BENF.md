## General

[__Schmutz et al. (2019)__](#schmutz-et-al-2019-easy-to-read-language-in-disability-friendly-web-sites-effects-on-nondisabled-users) did something.
[__Schmutz et al. (2018)__](#schmutz-et-al-2018-effects-of-accessible-website-design-on-nondisabled-users-age-and-device-as-moderating-factors) show that accessible website design benefits (higher task completion rate, faster task completion time and higher satisfaction) nondisabled users in all age ranges (young vs old), and among multiple devices (tablet vs laptop).
[__Schmutz et al. (2017)__](#schmutz-et-al-2017-implementing-recommendations-from-web-accessibility-guidelines-a-comparative-study-of-nondisabled-users-and-users-with-visual-impairments) showed something more.
[__Schmutz et al. (2016)__](#schmutz-et-al-2016-implementing-recommendations-from-web-accessibility-guidelines-would-they-also-provide-benefits-to-nondisabled-users) show that following high accessibility standards will lead to better performance (faster task completion time and higher task completion rate) and improved user ratings (within perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trusworthiness) in non-disabled users.

Schmutz et al. (2018) show the affect of accessible website design by analyzing completion time, completion rate and satisfaction ratingin a '2x2x2' comparison that has web siste accessibility (high vs low accessibility), age (old vs young), and device type (laptop vs table) as independent variables. They showed that higher accessibility increased task completion rate, task completion time and satisfaction ratings of nondisabled users. At the same time, they showed that accessibility benefits did not depend on the age, but that the benefits were greater when participants used a tablet rather than using a laptop. Finally, they showed than younger participants preferred the presentation on the tablet, whereas older people preferred the laptop.

```
Method: 
Sixty-one nondisabled participants used one of three Web sites differing in levels of accessibility (high, low, and very low). 
Accessibility levels were determined by following established Web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0). 
A broad methodological approach was used, including performance measures (e.g., task completion time) and user ratings (e.g., perceived usability).
```

```
Results: 
A high level of Web accessibility led to better performance (i.e., task completion time and task completion rate) than low or very low accessibility. 
Likewise, high Web accessibility improved user ratings (i.e., perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trustworthiness) compared to low or very low Web accessibility. 
There was no difference between the very low and low Web accessibility conditions for any of the outcome measures.
