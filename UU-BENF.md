## General

[__Schmutz et al. (2019)__](#schmutz-et-al-2019-easy-to-read-language-in-disability-friendly-web-sites-effects-on-nondisabled-users) did something.
[__Schmutz et al. (2018)__](#schmutz-et-al-2018-effects-of-accessible-website-design-on-nondisabled-users-age-and-device-as-moderating-factors) dis something more.
[__Schmutz et al. (2016)__](#schmutz-et-al-2016-implementing-recommendations-from-web-accessibility-guidelines-would-they-also-provide-benefits-to-nondisabled-users) show that following high accessibility standards will lead to better performance (faster task completion time and higher task completion rate) and improved user ratings (within perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trusworthiness) in non-disabled users.

```
Method: 
Sixty-one nondisabled participants used one of three Web sites differing in levels of accessibility (high, low, and very low). 
Accessibility levels were determined by following established Web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0). 
A broad methodological approach was used, including performance measures (e.g., task completion time) and user ratings (e.g., perceived usability).
```

```
Results: 
A high level of Web accessibility led to better performance (i.e., task completion time and task completion rate) than low or very low accessibility. 
Likewise, high Web accessibility improved user ratings (i.e., perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trustworthiness) compared to low or very low Web accessibility. 
There was no difference between the very low and low Web accessibility conditions for any of the outcome measures.
