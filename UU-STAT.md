## United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) (2019) Disability: Prevalence and Impact - Syrian Arab Republic 

[Up](#tekster-om-statistikk)

UNHCR (2019) measure the prevalence of people with disabilities by area, age group and population type.
They show that about 27% of the population in Syria live with disabilities compared to 15% of the world population.
They argue that disability is more present in developing and crisis-affected countries.

They show that the percentage of people with disabilities increases significantly from 40 years on.
(They show individual age groups in five year intervals.)
They found that wome were generally slightly less likey to have a disability than men.
They found that people with disabilities are more likely to be married or widowed than people without disabilities.
Women are especially likely to be widowed.

They found prevalence of different types of disabilities following the categorization proposed by the Washington Group (2017): M (17%), V (ca. 13%), S-C (ca. 8%), H (ca. 7%), Cog (ca. 4%), Com(ca. 4%).

## The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2018) Americans with Disabilities: 2014 

[Up](#tekster-om-statistikk)

The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2018) indicate that in 2014 the percentage of people with disabilities to about 27 %, 18% with severe disability and 10% needing assistance. 
They show that disabiliities increase with age:
Until 18 yrs only 17%, from 18 yrs 30%, from 65 yrs 58%, and from 75 yrs 70% have disabilities.
They show differences in disability (any) prevalence depending on race:
Blacks (around 35%), non-Hispanic Whites (32%), Hispanics (25%) and Asians (20%).
The same ranking is valid for severe disability and needs assistance.

Prevalence depending for different domains:
* communication domain (18 yrs+ / 65 yrs+):
   * difficulties seeing (5%/9%)
   * difficulties hearing (7%/20%)
   * difficulties having their speech understood (2%/4%).
* physical domain:
   * upper body (12%)
   * lower body (18%).
* mental domain:
either a specified condition or any other mental or emotional condition that seriously interfered with everyday acitvities prevalent in about 10% of adults. 
The prevalence depended on the age:
Around 12% (65 yrs+) or 9% (18-64) of people. 
Common symptoms can be seen in at least 16% of the adults, 7% being severe: 
   * depreseed or anxious: ca 11%,
   * coping with stress: ca 8%,
   * trouble concentrating: ca 7%,
   * trouble getting along with others: 4%.
   
About 13% had difficulties with ADL and 10% with iADL.
Most adults have a disability in one domain only (53%):
* pysical domain being most common (28%), followed by mental (14%) and communication domain (12%),
* women have most likely disability in physical (32%) and mental (14%) domains, while
* men have disabilities most likely in the communication domain (13%).

Adults with disabilities had a lower level of education, were less likely employed, learned less than people without disability even when employed, had a higher poverty rate, especially people with a severe disability, 

## The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2012) Americans with Disabilities: 2010 

[Up](#tekster-om-statistikk)

The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2012) indicate in 2010 the percentage of people with disabilities to about 19%, 12% with severe disability and 4% needing assistance. 
They show that disabiliities increase with age, as do severe disabilities and the need for personal assistance.
They point out that the aging of the baby/boomer cohort meat that a greater propotion of the population grew older and therefore in a group with higher risks of disability. 
They show differences in disability prevalence (any) depending on race:
Asians having the lowest rate (15%), Hispanics (18%), non-Hispanic Whites (18%) and Blacks (22%) - all numbers are age-adjusted.
The same ranking is valid for severe disability and needs assistance.

Prevalence depending for different domains:
* communication domain (15 yrs+ / 65 yrs+) (6%/18%):
   * difficulties seeing (3%/10%)
   * difficulties hearing (3%/11%)
   * difficulties having their speech understood (1%/2%).
* physical domain:
   * upper body (8%)
   * lower body (13%).
* mental domain:
about 6% of adults. 
Common symptoms can be seen in at least 4% of the adults: 
   * depreseed or anxious: ca 3%,
   * coping with stress: ca 3%,
   * trouble concentrating: ca 2%,
   * trouble getting along with others: 1%.
   
About 4% had difficulties with ADL and 6% with iADL.
Most adults have a disability in one domain only (59%):
The pysical domain is most common (81%), followed by mental (33%) and communication domain (30%),

Adults with disabilities were less likely employed, earned less than people without disability even when employed, had a higher poverty rate, especially people with a severe disability, 

## World Health Organization (WHO) (2011) World report on disability 

[Up](#tekster-om-statistikk)

* [1. Understanding disability](#1-understanding-disability)
* [2. Disability - a global picture](#2-disability-a-global-picture)

### 1. Understanding disability

[Over](#world-health-organization-who-2011-world-report-on-disability)

The World Health Organization (WHO) (2011) gives a genereal introduction in definitions and scope related to disability.

They descried the transition from an individua, medial model to a structural, social model, in whihc `people are viewed as being disabled by society rather than by theri bodies`.
However, the authors follow the model adopted in the ICF, the `bio-psycho-social model`, in which functioning and disability is `a dynamic interaction between health conditions and contextual factors, both personal and evnrironemntal` including for example problems arising from a health condition.

```
[D]isability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinder thei full and effective participation in societ on an equal basis with others.
```

Problems with human functioning can be categorized in three inter-connected areas:
1. Impariments: problems in body function or alterations in body structure.
2. Activity limitations: difficulties in executing activities.
3. Participation restirctions: problem with involvement in any area of life.

Health conditions (diseases, injuries and disorder) can influecne impairments and vice versa.
Disability arises from the interaction of health conditions and contextual factors:
* environmental factors: can be either facilitators or barriers.
* personal factors: can influence how much a person paricipates in society.

It also lists `a person's capacities to perform actions and the actual performance of those actions in real life`.

### 2. Disability - a global picture

[Over](#world-health-organization-who-2011-world-report-on-disability)

The World Health Organization (WHO) (2011) gives a genereal introduction in how to measure disability globally, and presents some estimates for the prevalence of disability.

Estimates differ widely. 
The WHO (2001) argues that the question design and reporting source can affect estimates.
For example, many developing countries only collect disbaility data through census and give only a narrow choice of impairments resulting in low disability prevalence rate.
Many developed countries record impairment, activity limitations and aprticipation restriction resulting in higher disabiltiy prevalence.

They present prevelance estimates from 
* natioanl surveys and censuses:
Surveys are difficult for comaprisons because most developing countris collect data on a narrower set of impairments resulting in lower prevalance rates. 
Typically based on the Washington Group cagegorizations.
* the World Health Survey of 2002-2004:
a face-to-face household survey in a total of 70 countries of which 59 ccountries were used for estimation. 
The prevalence for 18 yrs+ was ca 16%, with 12% in higher income countries and 18% in lower income countries.
Vulnerable groups (women, the poor, the elderly) had a higher rate of disability.
* the WHO Global Burden of Disease study, 2004:
They estimate that 19% of the world population have a disability, with ca 4% having a severe disability.
Theyt also estimate of moderate and severe disability prevalence to be 11% higher for women than for men related to higher age-specific prevalence / greater number of older women in the populaiton.

These are no definitive estimate.
WHO (2001) suggest to get more robust, comparable, and complete data sets.

They also list trends in health conditions associated with disability including infectious diseases, chronic conditions, and injuries.
The influence of demographics on disability.
Global ageing contrigutes to more disabilities.
The elderly have a higher risk of disability, and national populations are ageing.
In many countries, this ageing is associated with higher rates of survival to an older age and reduce fertility.
Since 1950, for example, the median age has increased: from 24 (1950), via 22 (1975) and 28 (2005) to an estimated 38 (2050).
These numbers are higher for high-income countries and lower for low- and middle income coutries.

They discuss the importance of environmental factors on disability including exposure to poor sanitation, malnutrition, lack of access to health care, changes caused by natural disasters of conflict situtations.

They also point out that people with disabilities often have worse educational and labor market otucomes, and are more likely to be poorer than people without disabilities in both developing and developed countries.

They highli9gh costs realted to disability:
* direct costs:
   * extra costs of living with disabilities
   * public spending on disability programmes
*indirects costs:
   * economic costs:
     * loss of productivity
     * exits from work or reduced worlk related to the onset of disability
     * loss of taxes related to the loss of productivity
   * non-economic costs:
      * social isolation
      * stress. 

Finally, they conclude that about 15% (WHS) / 19% (GBD) of the world population lives with disabilities.
Disability debends on many factors, including age, sex, stage of life, environmental rists, socioeconomic status, culture, and available resources.
They give recommendations for improving statistical data:
* Adapting the ICF
* Improving national disability statistics
* Improving the comparability of data
* Developing apporpirate tools and fill the research gaps
