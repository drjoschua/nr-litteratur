These articles, papers and chapters discuss assessment methods for accessibility and usability that are needed for the evaluation in universal design:
* [Assessment of Accessibility (ACC-ASS)](./ACC-ASS.md)
* [Assessment of Usability (USA-ASS)](./USA-ASS.md)

These articles discuss the realitionship between accessbility, usability and user experience:

[__Sauer et al. (2020)__ Usability, user experience and accessibility: towards an integrative model](#sauer-et-al-2020-usability-user-experience-and-accessibility-towards-an-integrative-model) did something.
[__Petrie & Bevan (2009)__](#petrie-bevan-2009-the-evaluation-of-accessibility-usability-and-user-experience) define the concepts of accessibility, usability and user experience, discuss two versions of the iterative user-centered design lifecycle, and present different evaluation methods for accessibility, usability and user experience including their strengths and weaknesses.

Petrie & Bevan (2009) define the concepts of accessibility, usability, and user experience (UX). You can read about this [here](./UU-DEF.md#petrie-bevan-2009-the-evaluation-of-accessibility-usability-and-user-experience)

They are introducing two strategies to design and evaluate inclusive applications:
* interactive, user-centered design, and
* inclusive design.

Finally, they discuss five evaluation methods for usability, accessibility and UX with their benefits and limitations:
1. Guidelines for accessibility and usability: including accessibility guidelines, usability guidelines and standards.
2. Automated checking of conformance to guidelines or standards.
3. Evaluations conducted by experts.
4. Evaluations using models and simulations: used when models are possible and economical, when user testing is not practical, especially when time is critical.
5. Evaluations with users: should be used at all stages of development, but especially at the final stage. It can reveal real use by target users, and uncovers evidence for accessibility and usability.
6. Evaluations using data collected during usage of the application.
