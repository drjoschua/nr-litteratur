Det fins noen tekster som handler om evaluringsmetoder for universell utforming:
* [Evaluation of Accessibility Testing Methods. Which Methods Uncover What Type of Problems?](#evaluation-of-accessibility-testing-methods-which-methods-uncover-what-type-of-problems)

Research by Bai et al. (2016) support the hypothesis that a combination of multiple assessment methods covers a wide range of critical and confusing accessibility issues. They showed that no single method is superior to any other, but presented evidents that a combination of expert testing methods can give good results.


## Evaluation of Accessibility Testing Methods. Which Methods Uncover What Type of Problems?

[Up](#tekster-som-handler-om-evalueringsmetoder-for-universell-utforming-uu-ass)

Bai et al. categorized assessment methods into four main groups based on knowledge and resources required to use the methods:
1. testing using automatic or semi-automatic tools and guidelines,
2. simulation kit where a weareable is used,
3. expert testing, and
4. testing with users.

They investigated whether assessment methods would reveal technical, usable, critical and/or confusing issues.
Moreover, they investigated whether a method would reveal a unique issue.

In their empirical evaluation, they investigated methods from the first three categories (Simulation kit -> 2, VATLab -> 3, Persona testing -> 3, WCAG -> 1 + 3) excluding user testing.
Their results showd no superior method among the methods investigated.
However, the experting testing methods were complementing each other for finding critical and confusing issues.
Thus, the authors advocate for using multiple methods.
