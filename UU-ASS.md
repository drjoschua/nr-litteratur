These articles, papers and chapters discuss assessment methods for accessibility and usability that are needed for the evaluation in universal design:
* [Assessment of Accessibility (ACC-ASS)](./ACC-ASS.md)
* [Assessment of Usability (USA-ASS)](./USA-ASS.md)

These articles discuss the realitionship between accessbility, usability and user experience:

## General

[__Sauer et al. (2020)__ Usability, user experience and accessibility: towards an integrative model](#sauer-et-al-2020-usability-user-experience-and-accessibility-towards-an-integrative-model) review common definitions of the concepts of usability, user experience (UX) and accessibility, discuss their relationship to each other and analyze definitions, evaluation methods and typical outcome measures.
They propose a new term called `interaction experience (IX)` as a higher-level concept expression.
[__Petrie & Bevan (2009)__](#petrie-bevan-2009-the-evaluation-of-accessibility-usability-and-user-experience) define the concepts of accessibility, usability and user experience, discuss two versions of the iterative user-centered design lifecycle, and present different evaluation methods for accessibility, usability and user experience including their strengths and weaknesses.

Sauer et al. (2020) give defintions for usability, user experience, and accessibility.

They explain user testing as settings where users interact with an artefact while being observed by one or more evaluator(s).
Qualitative and quantitative data is collected during this process, and a set of questionnaires is often followed in the aftermath of the evaluation. 
Questionnaires include PSSUO, Iso Metrics, SUMI, WAMMI.
They emphasize that expert evaluations are often not sufficient enough, because they are not considering users and their needs enough.

They state that user-based evaluations are also applied in UX evaluation by assessing emotional reactions o users.
They name the methods Geneva Emotion Wheel, the product emotion tool (PREMO), AttrakDiff, the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ)), etc.

They name three basic methods for evaluating accessibility:
* checklists: providing specific recommendations for users with impairments,
* cognitive (barrier) walkthroughs identifying barriers, and
* automatic checking tools that measure quantifiable parameters by the means of algorithms.

They point out that user testing with users with impairments is often considered to be too time or resource intensive, at the same time as it might be difficult to get access to relevant users.
Also, the testing setup has to be adapted to users with impairments

They introduce a new concept of `interaction experience (IX)`.

## Petrie & Bevan (2009) The evaluation of accessibility, usability and user experience 

[Up](#tekster-som-handler-om-evalueringsmetoder-for-universell-utforming-uu-ass)

Petrie & Bevan (2009) define the concepts of accessibility, usability, and user experience (UX). You can read about this [here](./UU-DEF.md#petrie-bevan-2009-the-evaluation-of-accessibility-usability-and-user-experience)

They are introducing two strategies to design and evaluate inclusive applications:
* interactive, user-centered design, and
* inclusive design.

Finally, they discuss five evaluation methods for usability, accessibility and UX with their benefits and limitations:
1. Guidelines for accessibility and usability: including accessibility guidelines, usability guidelines and standards.
2. Automated checking of conformance to guidelines or standards.
3. Evaluations conducted by experts.
4. Evaluations using models and simulations: used when models are possible and economical, when user testing is not practical, especially when time is critical.
5. Evaluations with users: should be used at all stages of development, but especially at the final stage. It can reveal real use by target users, and uncovers evidence for accessibility and usability.
6. Evaluations using data collected during usage of the application.
