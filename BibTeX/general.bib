  abstract  = {This paper presents three suggestions for better scientific abstracts: begin the abstract by briefly describing the nature of the paper (new data, review, critique, etc.); write the abstract not as an introduction to the paper but as a tersely styled summary of its essential information; and include as much specific information (locations, compositions, temperatures, etc.) as possible. Write the abstract after finishing the paper, to avoid the common fault of abstract that are good introductions but poor summaries.},

It should not be a mere recital of the subjects covered, replete with such expressions as "is discussed" and "is described". It should be a condensation and concentration of the essential qualities of the paper.},
