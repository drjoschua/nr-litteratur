  abstract  = {All people with abnormal colour vision, except for a few mildly affected deuteranomals, report that they experience problems with colour in everyday life and at work. Contemporary society presents them with increasing problems because colour is now so widely used in printed materials and in computer displays. Equal opportunity law gives them protection against unfair discrimination in employment, so a decision to exclude a person from employment on the grounds of abnormal colour vision must now be well supported by good evidence and sound argument. This paper reviews the investigations that have contributed to understanding the nature and consequences of the problems they have. 
All those with abnormal colour vision are at a disadvantage with comparative colour tasks that involve precise matching of colours or discrimination of fine colour differences either because of their loss of colour discrimination or anomalous perception of metamers. The majority have problems when colour is used to code information, in man-made colour codes and in naturally occurring colour codes that signal ripeness of fruit, freshness of meat or illness. They can be denied the benefit of colour to mark out objects and organise complex visual displays. They may be unreliable when a colour name is used as an identifier. They are slower and less successful in search when colour is an attribute of the target object or is used to organise the visual display. Because those with the more severe forms of abnormal colour vision perceive a very limited gamut of colours, they are at a disadvantage in the pursuit and appreciation of those forms of art that use colour.},
  comment   = {Four main categories of color tasks:
1. Comparative color tasks: Match two colors, or decide that two colors are different.
2. Connotative color tasks: Colors are assigned or have acquired specific meanings.
3. Denotative color tasks: Colors are used to mark out objects or to organize complex visual displays.
4. Aesthetic color tasks: Colors are used to create an emotional response or convey a mood.},

When this involves the shading of areas (and not only points or lines)—e.g., as in bar plots, pie charts, mosaic displays or heatmaps—it is important that the colors are perceptually based and do not introduce optical illusions or systematic bias. Based on the perceptually-based Hue-Chroma-Luminance (HCL) color space suitable color palettes are derived for coding categorical data (qualitative palettes) and numerical variables (sequential and diverging palettes).},

ColorBrewer is an online tool designed to take some of the guesswork out of this process by helping users select appropriate colour schemes for their specific mapping needs by considering: the number of data classes; the nature of their data (matched with sequential, diverging and qualitative schemes); and the end-use environment for the map (e.g., CRT, LCD, printed, projected, photocopied). ColorBrewer contains 'learn more' tutorials to help guide users, prompts them to test-drive colour schemes as both map and legend, and provides output in five colour specification systems.},

  abstract = {Color is frequently used to encode values in visualizations. For color encodings to be effective, the mapping between colors and values must preserve important differences in the data. However, most guidelines for effective color choice in visualization are based on either color perceptions measured using large, uniform fields in optimal viewing environments or on qualitative intuitions. These limitations may cause data misinterpretation in visualizations, which frequently use small, elongated marks. Our goal is to develop quantitative metrics to help people use color more effectively in visualizations. We present a series of crowdsourced studies measuring color difference perceptions for three common mark types: points, bars, and lines. Our results indicate that peoples' abilities to perceive color differences varies significantly across mark types. Probabilistic models constructed from the resulting data can provide objective guidance for designers, allowing them to anticipate viewer perceptions in order to inform effective encoding design.},

  abstract  = {Sufficient colour contrast between text and background is necessary for the text to be readable. WCAG2.0 defines contrast guidelines that ensure web pages can be read by people with a visual acuity of as low as 20/80. However, the WCAG2.0 specification is hard to understand for web-designers and they often perform colour checks after the design is finished using colour contrast calculators. It is then often too late to make significant changes to the design. This paper proposes a new colour selection scheme that integrates contrast constraints into the main design phase by only allowing designers to select colour pairs that contains sufficient contrast. The mechanism is compatible with the colour harmony systems commonly used by designers. The tool gives designers an easily perceivable overview of the design space of available colours. The paper briefly describes a prototype of a colour picker tool that implements the proposed scheme.},
