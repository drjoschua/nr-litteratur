  abstract   = {Thinking-aloud protocols may be the most widely used method in usability testing, but the descriptions of this practice in the usability literature and the work habits of practitioners do not conform to the theoretical basis most often cited for it: K.A. Ericsson and H.A. Simon's (1984) seminal work. After reviewing Ericsson and Simon's theoretical basis for thinking aloud, we review the ways in which actual usability practice diverges from this model. We then explore the concept of speech genre as an alternative theoretical framework. We first consider uses of this new framework that are consistent with Ericsson and Simon's goal of eliciting a verbal report that is as undirected, undisturbed and constant as possible. We then go on to consider how the proposed new approach might handle problems that arise in usability testing that appear to require interventions not supported in the older model.},

In this paper we examine the relationship between UX attributes and Web accessibility. We measured accessibility in two ways: the perceived accessibility as reported by participants and accessibility in terms of conformance to guidelines. Findings uncover that perceived Web accessibility is significantly correlated with 27 of the 35 UX attributes analysed, suggesting these two qualities are closely related. The relationship between UX and conformance to WCAG 2.0 is more elusive: we only found significant correlations between the hedonic attributes original, innovative and exciting.},

Engagement is presumed to be malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change. Researchers describe behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement and recommend studying engagement as a multifaceted construct. This article reviews definitions, measures, precursors, and outcomes of engagement; discusses limitations in the existing research; and suggests improvements. The authors conclude that, although much has been learned, the potential contribution of the concept of school engagement to research on student experience has yet to be realized. They call for richer characterizations of how students behave, feel, and think-research that could aid in the development offinely tuned interventions.},
  comment   = {"In conclusion, the research reviewed shows that behavioral engagement (e.g., participation, work behavior, and conduct) is correlated with higher achievement across various samples and ages. Similarly, the link between one aspect of cognitive engagement-strategy use-and achievement in the middle and high school years has been well documented. There also is some evidence of a correlation between emotional engagement and achievement. However, support for this correlation comes mainly from the literature on specific constructs incorporated into definitions of emotional engagement, such as interest and value."},

It consists of an exhibit-centric framework with a corresponding score for the accessibility indicators vision, hearing, mobility, motor, and cognition. The scores are achieved by combining the results of an observational study with a supplementary expert evaluation for high reliability. The methodology was successfully applied with pupils in an informal-learning context at Oslo Science Center. We believe it has relevance for and can be applied to other areas such as self-service machines and interactive technical artifacts in general due to its generic nature.},

Despite these concerns, there is a lack of empirical research on the effects of current Web accessibility guidelines on nondisabled users.Method:Sixty-one nondisabled participants used one of three Web sites differing in levels of accessibility (high, low, and very low). Accessibility levels were determined by following established Web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0). A broad methodological approach was used, including performance measures (e.g., task completion time) and user ratings (e.g., perceived usability).Results:A high level of Web accessibility led to better performance (i.e., task completion time and task completion rate) than low or very low accessibility. Likewise, high Web accessibility improved user ratings (i.e., perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trustworthiness) compared to low or very low Web accessibility. There was no difference between the very low and low Web accessibility conditions for any of the outcome measures.Conclusion:Contrary to some concerns in the literature and among practitioners, high conformance with Web accessibility guidelines may provide benefits to users without disabilities.Application:The findings may encourage more practitioners to implement WCAG 2.0 for the benefit of users with disabilities and nondisabled users.},

A web site usability test was conducted with 128 nondisabled participants. Each participant evaluated one of two web site versions: conventional language vs. easy-to-read language. Measures of performance (e.g., recognition of content and reading time) and subjective user reactions (e.g., perceived usability and text liking) were taken. The results showed that easy-to-read language (compared to conventional language) led to improvements for some performance measures (e.g., recognition of content) but also to increased reading time, decreased text liking and reduced intention to revisit the web site. This article concludes that when implementing easy-to-read language in web sites, adverse as well as beneficial effects on nondisabled users need to be considered.},

  abstract   = {This study examined how implementing recommendations from Web accessibility guidelines affects nondisabled people in different age groups using different technical devices. While recent research showed positive effects of implementing such recommendations for nondisabled users, it remains unclear whether such effects would apply to different age groups and kind of devices. A 2 × 2 × 2 design was employed with website accessibility (high accessibility vs. very low accessibility), age (younger adults vs. older adults) and type of device (laptop vs. tablet) as independent variables. 110 nondisabled participants took part in a usability test, in which performance and satisfaction were measured as dependent variables. The results showed that higher accessibility increased task completion rate, task completion time and satisfaction ratings of nondisabled users. While user age did not have any effects, users showed faster task completion time under high accessibility when using a tablet rather than a laptop. The findings confirmed previous findings, which showed benefits of accessible websites for nondisabled users. These beneficial effects may now be generalised to a wide age range and across different devices.Practitioner Summary: This work is relevant to the design of websites since it emphasises the need to consider the characteristics of different user groups. Accessible website design (aimed at users with disabilities) leads to benefits for nondisabled users across different ages. These findings provide further encouragement for practitioners to apply WCAG 2.0.},

However, it has been hardly examined whether this approach has side effects for nondisabled users. A comparison of the effects on both user groups would contribute to a better understanding of possible advantages and drawbacks of applying accessibility guidelines.Method:Participants from two matched samples, comprising 55 participants with visual impairments and 55 without impairments, took part in a synchronous remote testing of a Web site. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three Web sites, which differed in the level of accessibility (very low, low, and high) according to recommendations of the well-established Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0). Performance (i.e., task completion rate and task completion time) and a range of subjective variables (i.e., perceived usability, positive affect, negative affect, perceived aesthetics, perceived workload, and user experience) were measured.Results:Higher conformance to Web accessibility guidelines resulted in increased performance and more positive user ratings (e.g., perceived usability or aesthetics) for both user groups. There was no interaction between user group and accessibility level.Conclusion:Higher conformance to WCAG 2.0 may result in benefits for nondisabled users and users with visual impairments alike.Application:Practitioners may use the present findings as a basis for deciding on whether and how to implement accessibility best.},

This article examines the theoretical underpinnings and potential application of universal design by exploring its evolution through human rights and disability rights laws and policies. It is maintained that universal design arises from the complex relationship between human rights, disability rights, and access to and use of technology. Consequently, it is argued that in relation to the information society, it is most capable of promoting equal access and use of technology in three ways. First, universal design can increasingly account for human diversity. Second, universal design can progressively eliminate barriers to accessibility and usability. Third, universal design can augment broader participation in the design and development of technology. Conceptualising universal design foundations of usability and accessibility of technology as universal human rights precepts embraces social equality for everyone, and incorporates important but currently exclusive disability rights precepts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

However, copyright law and policy sometimes poses challenges to realizing full and equal access to the web for persons with varying physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities. Recent developments in international law and policy that promote the use of technological protection measures (TPM) as a means for protecting copyrighted digital content on the web create barriers to accessibility for certain individuals with disabilities. This article uses theories of multilevel governance and social regulation to explore the relationship among laws and policies that aim to ensure web accessibility, and laws and policies to preserve and promote the use of TPM. It employs a case study of U.S. law and policy to examine how different levels of governance have ensured and supported the rights of persons with cognitive disabilities and web content publishers. This article argues that the Marrakesh Treaty acts as a bridge between the copyright and human rights regimes, can promote the meaningful participation of persons with an array of cognitive and other disabilities in the design and implementation of national and international copyright laws and policies, and thus fosters harmonization of TPM with the principles of web accessibility.},

  abstract  = {Socially marginalised groups experience hostility in daily life, and hostility online adds to psychological pressure. For example, hate speech, typically defined as attacks on an individual or socially marginalised group, may impact access to web content for socially marginalised groups. In addition, rendered invisibility, for example being unable to choose your gender in a web form, may act as a psychological and practical barrier to accessing web content for groups, such as genderqueer, intersex and transgender persons. Research has yet to investigate the intersectionality of web accessibility. Preliminary results from semi-structured interviews with a select group of persons that experience multiple forms of discrimination suggest that marginalized individuals expect to experience oppressive content and consider oppressive content as a part of interacting with the web. In this paper, we examine a variety of oppressive mechanisms, including ableism, racism, and transphobia, and how in combination they relate to accessing and using web content. We argue that by ensuring the accessibility of web content substantively, future researchers and practitioners can promote a more universally accessible web. By taking into consideration experiences of hostility, web developers can better support access to information and communication on the web for everyone.},

We compare a laboratory study with blind users to an automated tool, expert review by web designers with and without a screen reader, and remote testing by blind users. Multiple developers, using a screen reader, were most consistently successful at finding most classes of problems, and tended to find about 50\% of known problems. Surprisingly, a remote study with blind users was one of the least effective methods. All of the techniques, however, had different, complementary strengths and weaknesses.},

To recruit an appropriate group of users and to observe their performance in the real world is difficult. For this reason we have developed RemoTest, a platform that assists researchers designing experiments, conducting remote and in-situ experimental sessions and analyzing the data gathered while the users are accessing the Web. Although this tool is oriented to experimenters, it is necessary to check whether the evaluation environments created by RemoTest are accessible or not to the users that participate in the tests. To this end, we conducted formal in-situ evaluations with 36 users with diverse characteristics. For this assessment, the participants were asked to install the platform, to fill in some automatically created questionnaires and to carry out several web navigation tasks. From the data gathered we analyzed the ease of the installation process, the accessibility of the automatically generated questionnaires, and user satisfaction. The results revealed the suitability of the platform for conducting inclusive experiments both in remote and in-situ contexts and provided guidelines on how the experiments should be set out.},

Usability consists of measuring the degree to which an interactive system can be used by specified final users to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use. Usability studies need to be complemented by an accessibility assessment. Accessibility indicates how easy it is for a person to access any content, regardless of their physical, educational, social, psychological, or cultural conditions. This chapter intends to conduct a systematic review of the literature on usability and accessibility in tele-rehabilitation platforms carried out through the PRISMA method. To do so, we searched in ACM, IEEE Xplore, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases for the most relevant papers of the last decade. The main result of the usability shows that the user experience predominates over the heuristic studies, and the usability questionnaire most used in user experience is the SUS. The main result of the accessibility reveals that the topic is only marginally studied. In addition, it is observed that Web applications do not apply the physical and cognitive accessibility standards defined by the WCAG 2.1.},

The ubiquitous nature and increasing complexity of technology mean that ensuring accessibility remains challenging. Accessibility evaluation refers to the process of examining a product and establishing the extent to which it supports accessibility through the identification of potential barriers. While accessibility guidelines can guide the development process and automated evaluation tools can assist in measuring conformance, they do not guarantee that products will be accessible in a live context. The most reliable way to evaluate the accessibility of a product is to conduct a study with representative users interacting with the product. This chapter outlines a range of methods which can be used to ensure that a product is designed to meet the requirements and specific needs of users, from the ideation phase to the design and iterative development. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are described, as well as the primary considerations to ensure that the results of a study are reliable and valid, and also participants are treated ethically. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the field as well as an examination of future trends such as how data from user studies can be used to influence the design of future accessibility guidelines to improve their efficacy.},

This has the potential both to reduce practical problems with securing user attendance and to allow direct involvement of users in usability testing. In this paper, we report from an empirical study where we systematically compared three methods for remote asynchronous usability testing: user-reported critical incidents, forum-based online reporting and discussion, and diary-based longitudinal user reporting. In addition, conventional laboratory-based think-aloud testing was included as a benchmark for the remote methods. The results show that each remote asynchronous method supports identification of a considerable number of usability problems. Although this is only about half of the problems identified with the conventional method, it requires significantly less time. This makes remote asynchronous methods an appealing possibility for usability testing in many software projects.},

To measure these characteristics we used the task completion rate, the task completion time, the Single Ease Question (SEQ), the Software Usability Scale (SUS) and AttrakDiff. Results indicate that there is a difference between effectiveness, efficiency and the users’ assessment of the devices. Users can carry out tasks more effectively and efficiently on laptops, but rate tablets higher in perceived usability and user experience, indicating that a pleasant and meaningful experience depends on more characteristics than work-related qualities such as effectiveness and efficiency.},

The present study investigates the relationship between web-accessibility and web-usability. To analyse this relationship we have designed an online test environment. We developed three complete internet presences (testportals), each one with a different level of accessibility. 131 test users were recruited viewed these three testportals and rated their usability. The instrument to evaluate usability was an especially modified and reduced version of the Web Usability Index (WUI) which was made available online in the form of a questionnaire. The central question this study sought to answer was: is there a difference in the usability ratings between websites with different levels of accessibility? The findings resulting from the central question were clear. The mean values show a significant difference in the usability ratings of the three portals. Other question our study sought to answer were the influences of the disability and the age factors. These influences are partly significant.},

Usability returns many benefits (return on investment [ROI]) to products developed for internal use or sale. It also plays a role in the public's perception of a company, affecting brand value and market share. Usability can also affect a company's financial health and public perception in less obvious ways. With an understanding of the basic benefits of usability, this chapter examines the evidence for a positive ROI, lists the key usability benefits and defines appropriate value propositions. For each of these value propositions, this chapter presents examples that help interpret the cost of usability challenges and/or it cites statistics. Although a cost-benefit analysis for every circumstance does not exist, these “proofs” of applying usability in UIs predict likely quantifiable benefits or ROI.},

  abstract = {Usability tests are a part of user-centered design. Usability testing with disabled people is necessary, if they are among the potential users. Several researchers have already investigated usability methods with sighted people. However, research with blind users is insufficient, for example, due to different knowledge on the use of assistive technologies and the ability to analyze usability issues from inspection of non-visual output of assistive devices. From here, the authors aspire to extend theory and practice by investigating four usability methods involving the blind, visually impaired and sighted people. These usability methods comprise of local test, synchronous remote test, tactile paper prototyping and computer-based prototyping. In terms of effectiveness of evaluation and the experience of participants and the facilitator, local tests were compared with synchronous remote tests and tactile paper prototyping with computer-based prototyping. Through the comparison of local and synchronous remote tests, it has been found that the number of usability problems uncovered in different categories with both approaches was comparable. In terms of task completion time, there is a significant difference for blind participants, but not for the visually impaired and sighted. Most of the blind and visually impaired participants prefer the local test. As for the comparison of tactile paper prototyping and computer-based prototyping, it has been revealed that tactile paper prototyping provides a better overview of an application while the interaction with computer-based prototypes is closer to reality. Problems regarding the planning and conducting of these methods as they arise in particular with blind people were also discussed. Based on the authors’ experiences, recommendations were provided for dealing with these problems from both the technical and the organization perspectives.},

This study investigated the effectiveness and efficiency of concurrent and retrospective verbal protocols (CVP and RVP) for both blind and sighted participants, as well as participant workload and attitudes towards these methods. Eight blind and eight sighted participants undertook both protocols in a website evaluation. RVP was more effective as measured by problems encountered for both groups, although it was no more efficient than CVP. The severity of problems identified by both protocols was equivalent. As measured on the NASA TLX, participants found RVP found more demanding than CVP. Sighted participants found rating problems during CVP more disruptive than blind participants. These results show that RVP is a more useful protocol for practitioners and researchers even though it takes more time and is more demanding for participants. It is equally applicable for both blind and sighted participants.},

Three experiments were conducted using different artefacts (website, computer-simulated mobile phone, fully operational smartphone) to compare different methodological approaches in field testing (synchronous and asynchronous remote testing, classical field testing) to lab-based testing under different operational conditions (dual task demands, poor product usability). Typical outcome variables of usability testing were measured, including task completion time, click rate, perceived usability and workload. Overall, the results showed no differences between field and lab-based testing under favourable operational conditions. However, under difficult operational conditions (i.e. dual task demands, poor product usability) differences between field and lab-based testing emerged (corresponding to small and medium effect sizes). The findings showed a complex pattern of effects, suggesting that there was no general advantage of one testing procedure over another.},

Most studies of this approach employ predefined tasks to ensure that users experience specific aspects of the system, whereas other studies use no task assignments. Yet the effect of using predefined tasks is still to be uncovered. There is also limited research on instructions for users in identifying usability problems. This paper reports from a comparative study of the effect of task assignments and instruction types on the problems identified in remote asynchronous usability testing of a website for information retrieval, involving 53 prospective users. The results show that users solving predefined tasks identified significantly more usability problems with a significantly higher level of agreement than those working on their own authentic tasks. Moreover, users that were instructed by means of examples of usability problems identified significantly more usability problems than those who received a conceptual definition of usability problems.},

For this reason, many human-computer interaction practitioners cannot conduct as many test iterations as they would like or may fail to secure representative samples, especially as user groups become more global. In recent years, we have begun to use less expensive remote evaluation techniques to complement traditional methods. This article describes some collaborative software that allows remote evaluations, along with the necessary hardware, to reproduce, as closely as possible, traditional evaluation techniques. It also describes the types of activities that lend themselves to this sort of approach and provides tips for conducting these sorts of sessions. Finally, this article provides data that suggest remote techniques are not only effective at improving interface designs, but also produce results comparable to traditional approaches for typical measures.},

From this review and description of extant options for remote testing, we provide methods and tools to achieve research goals remotely.BackgroundThe FDA mandates human factors evaluation of medical devices. Studies show similarities and differences in results collected in laboratories compared to data collected remotely in non-laboratory settings. Remote studies show promise, though many of these are behavioral studies related to cognitive or experimental psychology. Remote usability studies are rare but increasing, as technologies allow for synchronous and asynchronous data collection.MethodWe reviewed methods of remote evaluation of medical devices, from testing labels and instruction to usability testing and simulated use. Each method was coded for the attributes (e.g., supported media) that need consideration in usability studies.ResultsWe present examples of how published usability studies of medical devices could be moved to remote data collection. We also present novel systems for creating such tests, such as the use of 3D printed or virtual prototypes. Finally, we advise on targeted participant recruitment.ConclusionRemote testing will bring opportunities and challenges to the field of medical device testing. Current methods are adequate for most purposes, excepting the validation of Class III devices.ApplicationThe tools we provide enable the remote evaluation of medical devices. Evaluations have specific research goals, and our framework of attributes helps to select or combine tools for valid testing of medical devices.},

The multidimensionality of disability demands that more complex, flexible measures that will capture disability in all its manifestations be developed and adapted. The measurement of disability prevalence must be seen in light of the purpose that these data are collected for example, provision of services, assessment of the level of functioning in the population or equalisation of opportunities and inclusion of people with disabilities in society. Any reported disability prevalence rate is dependent both on the definition or aspect of disability that is being targeted and on the intended purpose for collecting disability statistics. Results from a national, representative survey of living conditions among people with disabilities in Zambia based, in part, on the work of the Washington Group on Disability Statistics (WG) that operationalises a functional approach to disability are presented and contrasted with historical census data to illustrate how a flexible approach to the measurement of disability is better suited to the multiple purposes of collecting disability statistics and to the diversity of disability in a population.

La nature multidimensionnelle du handicap requiert que des mesures plus complexes et souples, susceptibles d’appréhender le handicap dans toutes ses manifestations, soient développées et adaptées. La mesure de la prévalence du handicap doit être considérée en fonction de l’objectif qui préside à la collecte des données, c’est-à-dire, les services fournis, l’évaluation du niveau de fonctionnement de la population ou l’égalisation des chances et l’inclusion des personnes handicapées dans la société. Quel que soit le taux de prévalence du handicap enregistré, celui-ci dépend à la fois de la définition ou de la dimension du handicap prise pour cible et de l’objectif à l’origine de la collecte de données statistiques. Les résultats d’une enquête nationale, représentative des conditions de vie des personnes handicapées en Zambie, fondée pour partie sur les travaux du Washington Group sur les statistiques du handicap destinés à opérationnaliser une approche fonctionnelle du handicap, sont présentés et mis en perspective avec les données précédentes de recensement. Ainsi, nous illustrons comment une approche adaptée de la mesure du handicap s’avère plus apte à prendre en compte la multiplicité des objectifs de constitution de données statistiques sur le handicap et la diversité du handicap dans une population.},

In three years of use, our colleagues and we have extended Alan Cooperís technique to make Personas a powerful complement to other usability methods. After describing and illustrating our approach, we outline the psychological theory that explains why Personas are more engaging than design based primarily on scenarios. As Cooper and others have observed, Personas can engage team members very effectively. They also provide a conduit for conveying a broad range of qualitative and quantitative data, and focus attention on aspects of design and use that other methods do not.},
