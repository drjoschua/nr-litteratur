  abstract  = {The concept of school engagement has attracted increasing attention as representing a possible antidote to declining academic motivation and achievement. Engagement is presumed to be malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change. Researchers describe behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement and recommend studying engagement as a multifaceted construct. This article reviews definitions, measures, precursors, and outcomes of engagement; discusses limitations in the existing research; and suggests improvements. The authors conclude that, although much has been learned, the potential contribution of the concept of school engagement to research on student experience has yet to be realized. They call for richer characterizations of how students behave, feel, and think-research that could aid in the development offinely tuned interventions.},
  comment   = {"In conclusion, the research reviewed shows that behavioral engagement (e.g., participation, work behavior, and conduct) is correlated with higher achievement across various samples and ages. Similarly, the link between one aspect of cognitive engagement-strategy use-and achievement in the middle and high school years has been well documented. There also is some evidence of a correlation between emotional engagement and achievement. However, support for this correlation comes mainly from the literature on specific constructs incorporated into definitions of emotional engagement, such as interest and value."},
