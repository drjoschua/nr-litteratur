  abstract  = {The concept of school engagement has attracted increasing attention as representing a possible antidote to declining academic motivation and achievement. Engagement is presumed to be malleable, responsive to contextual features, and amenable to environmental change. Researchers describe behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement and recommend studying engagement as a multifaceted construct. This article reviews definitions, measures, precursors, and outcomes of engagement; discusses limitations in the existing research; and suggests improvements. The authors conclude that, although much has been learned, the potential contribution of the concept of school engagement to research on student experience has yet to be realized. They call for richer characterizations of how students behave, feel, and think-research that could aid in the development offinely tuned interventions.},
  comment   = {"In conclusion, the research reviewed shows that behavioral engagement (e.g., participation, work behavior, and conduct) is correlated with higher achievement across various samples and ages. Similarly, the link between one aspect of cognitive engagement-strategy use-and achievement in the middle and high school years has been well documented. There also is some evidence of a correlation between emotional engagement and achievement. However, support for this correlation comes mainly from the literature on specific constructs incorporated into definitions of emotional engagement, such as interest and value."},

It consists of an exhibit-centric framework with a corresponding score for the accessibility indicators vision, hearing, mobility, motor, and cognition. The scores are achieved by combining the results of an observational study with a supplementary expert evaluation for high reliability. The methodology was successfully applied with pupils in an informal-learning context at Oslo Science Center. We believe it has relevance for and can be applied to other areas such as self-service machines and interactive technical artifacts in general due to its generic nature.},

Despite these concerns, there is a lack of empirical research on the effects of current Web accessibility guidelines on nondisabled users.Method:Sixty-one nondisabled participants used one of three Web sites differing in levels of accessibility (high, low, and very low). Accessibility levels were determined by following established Web accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.0). A broad methodological approach was used, including performance measures (e.g., task completion time) and user ratings (e.g., perceived usability).Results:A high level of Web accessibility led to better performance (i.e., task completion time and task completion rate) than low or very low accessibility. Likewise, high Web accessibility improved user ratings (i.e., perceived usability, aesthetics, workload, and trustworthiness) compared to low or very low Web accessibility. There was no difference between the very low and low Web accessibility conditions for any of the outcome measures.Conclusion:Contrary to some concerns in the literature and among practitioners, high conformance with Web accessibility guidelines may provide benefits to users without disabilities.Application:The findings may encourage more practitioners to implement WCAG 2.0 for the benefit of users with disabilities and nondisabled users.},

A web site usability test was conducted with 128 nondisabled participants. Each participant evaluated one of two web site versions: conventional language vs. easy-to-read language. Measures of performance (e.g., recognition of content and reading time) and subjective user reactions (e.g., perceived usability and text liking) were taken. The results showed that easy-to-read language (compared to conventional language) led to improvements for some performance measures (e.g., recognition of content) but also to increased reading time, decreased text liking and reduced intention to revisit the web site. This article concludes that when implementing easy-to-read language in web sites, adverse as well as beneficial effects on nondisabled users need to be considered.},

  abstract   = {This study examined how implementing recommendations from Web accessibility guidelines affects nondisabled people in different age groups using different technical devices. While recent research showed positive effects of implementing such recommendations for nondisabled users, it remains unclear whether such effects would apply to different age groups and kind of devices. A 2 × 2 × 2 design was employed with website accessibility (high accessibility vs. very low accessibility), age (younger adults vs. older adults) and type of device (laptop vs. tablet) as independent variables. 110 nondisabled participants took part in a usability test, in which performance and satisfaction were measured as dependent variables. The results showed that higher accessibility increased task completion rate, task completion time and satisfaction ratings of nondisabled users. While user age did not have any effects, users showed faster task completion time under high accessibility when using a tablet rather than a laptop. The findings confirmed previous findings, which showed benefits of accessible websites for nondisabled users. These beneficial effects may now be generalised to a wide age range and across different devices.Practitioner Summary: This work is relevant to the design of websites since it emphasises the need to consider the characteristics of different user groups.

  abstract   = {Objective:The present study examined whether implementing recommendations of Web accessibility guidelines would have different effects on nondisabled users than on users with visual impairments.Background:The predominant approach for making Web sites accessible for users with disabilities is to apply accessibility guidelines. However, it has been hardly examined whether this approach has side effects for nondisabled users. A comparison of the effects on both user groups would contribute to a better understanding of possible advantages and drawbacks of applying accessibility guidelines.Method:Participants from two matched samples, comprising 55 participants with visual impairments and 55 without impairments, took part in a synchronous remote testing of a Web site. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of three Web sites, which differed in the level of accessibility (very low, low, and high) according to recommendations of the well-established Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0). Performance (i.e., task completion rate and task completion time) and a range of subjective variables (i.e., perceived usability, positive affect, negative affect, perceived aesthetics, perceived workload, and user experience) were measured.Results:Higher conformance to Web accessibility guidelines resulted in increased performance and more positive user ratings (e.g., perceived usability or aesthetics) for both user groups. There was no interaction between user group and accessibility level.Conclusion:Higher conformance to WCAG 2.0 may result in benefits for nondisabled users and users with visual impairments alike.Application:Practitioners may use the present findings as a basis for deciding on whether and how to implement accessibility best.},

This article examines the theoretical underpinnings and potential application of universal design by exploring its evolution through human rights and disability rights laws and policies. It is maintained that universal design arises from the complex relationship between human rights, disability rights, and access to and use of technology. Consequently, it is argued that in relation to the information society, it is most capable of promoting equal access and use of technology in three ways. First, universal design can increasingly account for human diversity. Second, universal design can progressively eliminate barriers to accessibility and usability. Third, universal design can augment broader participation in the design and development of technology. Conceptualising universal design foundations of usability and accessibility of technology as universal human rights precepts embraces social equality for everyone, and incorporates important but currently exclusive disability rights precepts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

  abstract   = {The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) obligates State Parties to ensure full and equal access to the web for persons with disabilities. However, copyright law and policy sometimes poses challenges to realizing full and equal access to the web for persons with varying physical, mental, and cognitive disabilities. Recent developments in international law and policy that promote the use of technological protection measures (TPM) as a means for protecting copyrighted digital content on the web create barriers to accessibility for certain individuals with disabilities. This article uses theories of multilevel governance and social regulation to explore the relationship among laws and policies that aim to ensure web accessibility, and laws and policies to preserve and promote the use of TPM. It employs a case study of U.S. law and policy to examine how different levels of governance have ensured and supported the rights of persons with cognitive disabilities and web content publishers. This article argues that the Marrakesh Treaty acts as a bridge between the copyright and human rights regimes, can promote the meaningful participation of persons with an array of cognitive and other disabilities in the design and implementation of national and international copyright laws and policies, and thus fosters harmonization of TPM with the principles of web accessibility.},

  abstract  = {Socially marginalised groups experience hostility in daily life, and hostility online adds to psychological pressure. For example, hate speech, typically defined as attacks on an individual or socially marginalised group, may impact access to web content for socially marginalised groups. In addition, rendered invisibility, for example being unable to choose your gender in a web form, may act as a psychological and practical barrier to accessing web content for groups, such as genderqueer, intersex and transgender persons. Research has yet to investigate the intersectionality of web accessibility. Preliminary results from semi-structured interviews with a select group of persons that experience multiple forms of discrimination suggest that marginalized individuals expect to experience oppressive content and consider oppressive content as a part of interacting with the web. In this paper, we examine a variety of oppressive mechanisms, including ableism, racism, and transphobia, and how in combination they relate to accessing and using web content. We argue that by ensuring the accessibility of web content substantively, future researchers and practitioners can promote a more universally accessible web. By taking into consideration experiences of hostility, web developers can better support access to information and communication on the web for everyone.},
