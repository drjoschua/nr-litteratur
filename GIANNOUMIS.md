Giannoumis et al. (2017) explore the interaction between laws and plicis to preserve and promote the use of technological protection measures (TPMs) to protect copyrighted digital content, and laws and plicies aiming at ensuring web accessbility for people with sensory and cognitive disabilities. They emphasize that the Marrakesh Treaty bridges the gap between accessibility requirements and copyright demands by obligating states to ensure that TPMS do not prevent individuals with print disabilities to create, use and share accessible formats withou a license form the copyright owner.
