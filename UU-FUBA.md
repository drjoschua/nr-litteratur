Moreover, WAI names some of the functional disabilities and barriers that are a focus point of usability and accessibility including:
* auditory (deafness, hard of hearing, deaf-blindness),
* cognitive (attention, memory, social communication and interaction), learning, and neurological (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), learning disabilities, mental health disbilities like anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders), 
* physical (amputation, rheumatism, arthritis, fibromyalgia, reduced dexterity, muscular dystrophy, repetitive stress injury (RSI), tremor and spasms),
* speech (apraxia of speech (AOS), cluttering, dysarthria, speech sound disorder, stuttering, muteness),
* visual (blindness, color vision deficiencies, low vision, deaf-blindness).

__Participants__:  
Children with:
* low vision
* hearing disabilities (hearing aids, cochlear implants, etc.)
* cerebral parese

Halbach and Tjøstheim (2019) propose a methodology for assessing the degree of accessibility of museum and science center exhibits based on six areas of impairments (V, H, M, MT, VC, C), four areas of assessment (getting to/from, perceive, control, understand), and four degrees of (in-)accessibility.

Six areas of impairments:
* sensor:
   * vision (V),
   * hearing (H),
* mobility (M) everything related to the legs,
* motor (MT) everything related to use of hands and arms to interact with something,
* voice (VC), and 
* cognition (C) including orientation, language, reasoning, memory, concentration, coordination, learning and engagement.

## Madans et al. (2011) Measuring disability and monitoring the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: the work of the Washington Group on Disability Statistics 

[Up](#tekster-som-handler-om-funskjonsnedsettelser-og-barrierer-uu-fuba)

The Washington Group is a voluntary working group founded in 2001 and made up of representatives of National Statistical Offices and international, non-governmental and disability organizations within the United Nations Statistical Division. Its main goal is a cultural neutral and reasonably standardized disability definition and measurement. The WG uses the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as framework and proposes a short set of six disability-related questions that can be used as a measurement tool for use in both censuses and surveys.

The WG is based on the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) that aims on the full and effective participation and inclusion in society, non-discrimination, accessibility and equality of opportunity for people with disabilities. Its major objective is the development of tools to collect comparable information on disability throughout the world by providing a short set of disability measures that can be used in census and surveys, and by recommending categorizations measuring different aspects or forms of disability. The tools by the WG can be used to monitor the participation of people with disabilities for example by cross-referencing prevalence of certain disabilities with the employment numbers.

The WG sees disability as `the outcome of the interaction of a person and his/her environment (physical, social, cultural or legislative) and represents a measure of the negative impact of environmental factors on one's ability to participate`. Different studies have revealed different prevalence number because they ask different questions and ask different things. The WG addresses the question whether people with disabilities participated in activities such as education, employment or family/civic life. Instead of asking if somebody is disabled, they propose to investigate difficulties in functioning in basic actions that are the building block for more complex activities. Their rationale is that having difficulties in these functioning may lead to decreases participation. The outcome of these tools is comparable data cross-nationally for different countries representing (a) the majority of persons with limitations in basic actions, (b)the most commonly occurring limitations in basic actions, and (c) to capture persons with similar problems across countries.

The WG provides a short set of questions:
```
The next questions ask about difficulties you may have doing certain activities because of a HEALTH PROBLEM:
(a) Do you have difficulty seeing, even if wearing glasses?
(b) Do you have difficulty hearing, even if using a hearing aid?
(c) Do you have difficulty walking or climbing steps?
(d) Do you have difficulty remembering or concentrating?
(e) Do you have difficulty (with self-care such as) washing all over or dressing?
(f) Using your usual (customary) language, do you have difficulty communicating. (for example, understanding or being understood by others)?
```

Each question has four response categories (severity scale):
```
(1) No, no difficulty.
(2) Yes, some difficulty.
(3) Yes, a lot of difficulty.
(4) Cannot do it at all.
```

The WG proposes to also gather information about environmental barriers or facilitators:
* micro-environmental: personal and technical assistance.
* meso-environmental: environment beyond the person.
* macro-environmental: effects on a regional, societal or national scale. 

They also show results from international studies using the short question sets.

### 6. Enabling environments

Barriers to infomation and communication.  
Addressing the barriers to information and technology.  

### World Health Organization (WHO) (2001) International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)

[Up](#tekster-som-handler-om-funskjonsnedsettelser-og-barrierer-uu-fuba)

The World Health Organization (WHO) (2001) presents a classification framework that can serve as scientific basis for understanding impairments, disabilities and its factors, establish a common language, permit comparison of data, and provide a systematic coding scheme for all elements involved.

The ICF encompasses all aspects of human health and some health-relevant components. The ICF describes human functioning and its restrictions and provides a framework to organize this information. The information is organized in:

* Part 1. __Functioning and disability__: can be expressed to indicate problems («disability») or indicate nonproblematic neutral aspects («functioning»)  
   * 1.1. __Body functions and structures__: interpreted by constructs and operationalized by qualifiers:  
     * 1.1.1. __Body functions__: `physiological functions of body systems` interpreted by changes in physiological systems and anatomical structures.  
     * 1.1.2. __Body structures__: `anatomical parts of the body such as organs, limbs and their components` interpreted by capacity and performance  
   * 1.2. __Activities and participation__
     * 1.2.1. __Activity__: `the execution of a task or action by an individual`.
     * 1.2.2. __Participation__: `[the] involvement in a life situation`.
* Part 2. __Contextual factors__
   * 2.1. __Environmental factors__: `make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives` organized from the individual's most immediate environment to the general environment.  
      * 2.2.1. __Individual__ the immediate environment of the individual.
      * 2.2.2. __Societal__ formal and informal social structures in the community or society that have an impact on individuals
   * 2.2. __Personal factors__: The particular background on an individual's life and living. Not further classified in the ICF.

### 1.1. Body functions and structures

Impairments represent a deviation from the statistical norm.
They can be temporary or permanent; progressive, regressive, or static; intermittent or continuous.

#### 1.1.1. Body functions

The ICF proposes eight chapters for body functions:
1. Mental functions: of the brain.
   * Global mental functions (orientation, intellectual, temperament and personality, etc.).
   * Specific mental functions (attention, memory, emotional, perceptual, calculation, etc.).
2. Sensory functions and pain: functions of the senses, seeing, hearing, tasting as well as pain. 
   * Seeing and related functions
   * Hearing and vestibular functions
   * Additional sensory functions.
   * Pain. 
3. Voice and speech functions of producing sounds and speech.
4. Functions of the cardiovascular, hematological, immunological and respiratory systems
5. Functions of the digestive, metabolic and endocrine systems
6. Genitourinary and reproductive functions
7. Neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions of movement and mobility.
   * Functions of the joints and bones
   * Muscle functions
   * Movement functions
8. Functions of the skin and related structures

#### 1.1.2. Body structures

The ICF proposes eight chapters for body structures:
1. Structures of the nervous system
2. The eye, ear and related structures
3. Structures involved in voice and speech
4. Structures of the cardiovascular, immunological and respiratory systems
5. Structures related to the digestive, metabolic and endocrine systems
6. Structures related to the genitourinary and reproductive systems
7. Structures related to movement
8. Skin and related structures

### 1.2. Activities and participation

There are nine domains (cf. Fig.2): 
1. learning and applying knowledge, 
2. general tasks and demands, 
3. communication, 
4. mobility, 
5. self-care, 
6. domestic life, 
7. interpersonal interactions and relationships, 
8. major life areas, 
9. community, social and civic life. 

Every domain can be qualified in terms of performance and capacity.
The performance `describes what an individual does in his or her current environment`.
The capacity `describes an individual's ability to execute a task or an action`.
Both qualifiers can be used with and without assistive devices or personal assistance.
Limitations or restrictions are measured against the statistical norm.

### Part 2. Contextual factors

Environmental factors interact with the components in body functions and structures and in activities and participation (cf. Fig.3):
An individual’s functioning is an interaction between the health condition and contextual factors.
Interventions may modify one or more of the other entities.
The interactions work in both directions.
The ICF proposes five environmental factors:
1. Products and technology
2. Natural environment and human-made changes to environment
3. Support and relationships
4. Attitudes
5. Services, systems and policies

### How to use the ICF

The ICF is an alphanumeric system using the letters __b__ (Body Functions), __s__ (Body Structures), __d__ (Activities and Participation), and __e__ (Environmental Factors),
followed by the chapter number (1 digit),
followed by the second level (2 digits),
followed by the third and fourth level (1 digit each).
A qualifier indicating the magnitude is coded as 1 or 2 numbers after a point.
The scale of an qualifier ranges from 0-4: __0__ (no problem), __1__ (mild problem), __2__ (moderate problem), __3__ (severe problem), and __4__ (complete problem).
For facilitators, the point is replaced with a + sign.

Story et al. (1998) categorize human functions or abilities into 8 groups:
* cognition is the ability of `receiving, comprehending, interpreting, remembering or acting on information`.
* vision  is the ability of `perceiving visual stimuli`,
* hearing and speech is the ability of `perceiving audtiory stimuli`, 
* body function is the ability of `performing common tasks` especially those related to the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system, 
* arm function is the ability of `in upper extremity range of motion, coordination and strength`, 
* hand function is the ability of performing tasks related to the hands like grasping, squeezing, etc., and
* mobility is the ability of performing tasks related to the lower extremities like walking, rising, etc.
