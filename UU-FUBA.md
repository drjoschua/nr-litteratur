The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) (2020) explores the nature of functional diversity including age-related impairments, multiple disabilities, health conditions, changing abilities, temprorary impairments, and situational limitations.
Moreover, WAI names some of the functional disabilities and barriers that are a focus point of usability and accessibility including:
* auditory (deafness, hard of hearing, deaf-blindness),
* cognitive (attention, memory, social communication and interaction), learning, and neurological (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), learning disabilities, mental health disbilities like anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders), 
* physical (amputation, rheumatism, arthritis, fibromyalgia, reduced dexterity, muscular dystrophy, repetitive stress injury (RSI), tremor and spasms),
* speech (apraxia of speech (AOS), cluttering, dysarthria, speech sound disorder, stuttering, muteness),
* visual (blindness, color vision deficiencies, low vision, deaf-blindness).

__Participants__:  
Children with:
* low vision
* hearing disabilities (hearing aids, cochlear implants, etc.)
* cerebral parese

Halbach and Tjøstheim (2019) propose a methodology for assessing the degree of accessibility of museum and science center exhibits based on six areas of impairments (V, H, M, MT, VC, C), four areas of assessment (getting to/from, perceive, control, understand), and four degrees of (in-)accessibility.

Six areas of impairments:
* sensor:
   * vision (V),
   * hearing (H),
* mobility (M) everything related to the legs,
* motor (MT) everything related to use of hands and arms to interact with something,
* voice (VC), and 
* cognition (C) including orientation, language, reasoning, memory, concentration, coordination, learning and engagement.

The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2018) define someone with disability status as: 
* having a wheelchair, cane, crutches, walker, etc., 
* difficulties seeing and hearing, 
* having difficulties performing functional activities (speaking, lifting/carrying, stairs, walking, grasping), 
* problems with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (getting in/out of bed, bathing, dressing, eating, and toileting) or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL) (going outside, money & bills, preparing meals, doing housework, using the telephone, etc.), 
* having a specific condition (learning disability, cerebral palsy, developmental or intellectual disability, Alzheimer's, blind, deaf, mental/emotional condition), 
* having a mental or emotional condition that seriously interfered with everyday activities (depression, anxiety, trouble getting along with others, trouble concentrating, trouble coping with stress).


They define three domains of disability:
* communication domain: 
Problems realted to seeing, hearing or having their speech understood.
* physical domain:
Problems with one or more functional activities.
* mental domain:
Either a specified condition or any other mental or emotional condition that seriously interfered with everyday acitvities (both ADL and iADL).

## Madans et al. (2011) Measuring disability and monitoring the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: the work of the Washington Group on Disability Statistics 

[Up](#tekster-om-funksjonsnedsettelser-og-barrierer)

The Washington Group is a voluntary working group founded in 2001 and made up of representatives of National Statistical Offices and international, non-governmental and disability organizations within the United Nations Statistical Division. Its main goal is a cultural neutral and reasonably standardized disability definition and measurement. The WG uses the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as framework and proposes a short set of six disability-related questions that can be used as a measurement tool for use in both censuses and surveys.

The WG is based on the UN Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) that aims on the full and effective participation and inclusion in society, non-discrimination, accessibility and equality of opportunity for people with disabilities. Its major objective is the development of tools to collect comparable information on disability throughout the world by providing a short set of disability measures that can be used in census and surveys, and by recommending categorizations measuring different aspects or forms of disability. The tools by the WG can be used to monitor the participation of people with disabilities for example by cross-referencing prevalence of certain disabilities with the employment numbers.

The WG sees disability as `the outcome of the interaction of a person and his/her environment (physical, social, cultural or legislative) and represents a measure of the negative impact of environmental factors on one's ability to participate`. Different studies have revealed different prevalence number because they ask different questions and ask different things. The WG addresses the question whether people with disabilities participated in activities such as education, employment or family/civic life. Instead of asking if somebody is disabled, they propose to investigate difficulties in functioning in basic actions that are the building block for more complex activities. Their rationale is that having difficulties in these functioning may lead to decreases participation. The outcome of these tools is comparable data cross-nationally for different countries representing (a) the majority of persons with limitations in basic actions, (b)the most commonly occurring limitations in basic actions, and (c) to capture persons with similar problems across countries.

The WG provides a short set of questions:
```
The next questions ask about difficulties you may have doing certain activities because of a HEALTH PROBLEM:
(a) Do you have difficulty seeing, even if wearing glasses?
(b) Do you have difficulty hearing, even if using a hearing aid?
(c) Do you have difficulty walking or climbing steps?
(d) Do you have difficulty remembering or concentrating?
(e) Do you have difficulty (with self-care such as) washing all over or dressing?
(f) Using your usual (customary) language, do you have difficulty communicating. (for example, understanding or being understood by others)?
```

Each question has four response categories (severity scale):
```
(1) No, no difficulty.
(2) Yes, some difficulty.
(3) Yes, a lot of difficulty.
(4) Cannot do it at all.
```

The WG proposes to also gather information about environmental barriers or facilitators:
* micro-environmental: personal and technical assistance.
* meso-environmental: environment beyond the person.
* macro-environmental: effects on a regional, societal or national scale. 

They also show results from international studies using the short question sets.

[Up](#tekster-om-funksjonsnedsettelser-og-barrierer)

Story et al. (1998) categorize human functions or abilities into 8 groups:
* cognition is the ability of `receiving, comprehending, interpreting, remembering or acting on information`.
* vision  is the ability of `perceiving visual stimuli`,
* hearing and speech is the ability of `perceiving audtiory stimuli`, 
* body function is the ability of `performing common tasks` especially those related to the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and central nervous system, 
* arm function is the ability of `in upper extremity range of motion, coordination and strength`, 
* hand function is the ability of performing tasks related to the hands like grasping, squeezing, etc., and
* mobility is the ability of performing tasks related to the lower extremities like walking, rising, etc.
