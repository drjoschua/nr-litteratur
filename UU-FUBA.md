## General

[__W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) (2020)__](#w3c-web-accessibility-initiative-wai-2020-diverse-abilities-and-barriers) explore functional diversity (age, intersectionality, health, changing, temporary, situational) and present functional disabilities and barriers that are the concern of usability and accessibility including auditory, cognitive, learning, and neurological, physical, speech and visual disabilities and barriers.
[__European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) (2019)__](#european-telecommunications-standards-institute-etsi-2019-en-301-549-v311-2019-06-accessibility-requirements-for-ict-products-and-services) defines requirements for functional accessibility in ICT products and services that should be upheld in public procurement, providing test procedures and evaluation methodology.
[__Halbach and Tjøstheim (2019)__](#halbach-and-tjøstheim-2019-towards-reliable-accessibility-assessments-of-science-center-exhibits) propose a methodology for assessing the degree of accessibility of museum and science center exhibits based on six areas of impairments (V, H, M, MT, VC, C), four areas of assessment (getting to/from, perceive, control, understand), and four degrees of (in-)accessibility.
[__The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2018)__](#the-united-states-census-bureau-usbc-2018-americans-with-disabilities-2014) define and list three disability domains: communication (seeing, hearing and speech), physical (upper and lower body), and mental (cognitive, mental and emotional).

The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) (2020) explores the nature of functional diversity including age-related impairments, multiple disabilities, health conditions, changing abilities, temprorary impairments, and situational limitations.
Moreover, WAI names some of the functional disabilities and barriers that are a focus point of usability and accessibility including:
* auditory (deafness, hard of hearing, deaf-blindness),
* cognitive (attention, memory, social communication and interaction), learning, and neurological (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), learning disabilities, mental health disbilities like anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders), 
* physical (amputation, rheumatism, arthritis, fibromyalgia, reduced dexterity, muscular dystrophy, repetitive stress injury (RSI), tremor and spasms),
* speech (apraxia of speech (AOS), cluttering, dysarthria, speech sound disorder, stuttering, muteness),
* visual (blindness, color vision deficiencies, low vision, deaf-blindness).

## Halbach and Tjøstheim (2019) Towards Reliable Accessibility Assessments of Science Center Exhibits 

[Up](#tekster-om-funksjonsnedsettelser-og-barrierer)

__Participants__:  
Children with:
* low vision
* hearing disabilities (hearing aids, cochlear implants, etc.)
* cerebral parese

Halbach and Tjøstheim (2019) propose a methodology for assessing the degree of accessibility of museum and science center exhibits based on six areas of impairments (V, H, M, MT, VC, C), four areas of assessment (getting to/from, perceive, control, understand), and four degrees of (in-)accessibility.

Six areas of impairments:
* sensor:
   * vision (V),
   * hearing (H),
* mobility (M) everything related to the legs,
* motor (MT) everything related to use of hands and arms to interact with something,
* voice (VC), and 
* cognition (C) including orientation, language, reasoning, memory, concentration, coordination, learning and engagement.

## European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) (2019) EN 301 549 v3.1.1 (2019-06): Accessibility requirements for ICT products and services

EN 301 549 defines requirements for functional accessibility in ICT products and services, providing test procedures and evaluation methodology.
This standard defines eleven functional performance statement that should be fulfilled to enable people to locate, identify and operate ICT functions regardless of physical, cognitive or sensory abilities, may they be permanent, temporary or situational:
1. Usage without vision
2. Usage with limited vision
3. Usage without perception of color
4. Usage without hearing
5. Usage with limited hearing
6. Usage without vocal capability
7. Usage with limited manipulation or strength
8. Usage with limited reach
9. Usage with limited reach
9. Minimize photosensitive seizure triggers
10. Usage with limited cognition
11. Privacy

## The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2018) Americans with Disabilities: 2014 

[Up](#tekster-om-funksjonsnedsettelser-og-barrierer)

The United States Census Bureau (USBC) (2018) define someone with disability status as: 
* having a wheelchair, cane, crutches, walker, etc., 
* difficulties seeing and hearing, 
* having difficulties performing functional activities (speaking, lifting/carrying, stairs, walking, grasping), 
* problems with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) (getting in/out of bed, bathing, dressing, eating, and toileting) or Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (iADL) (going outside, money & bills, preparing meals, doing housework, using the telephone, etc.), 
* having a specific condition (learning disability, cerebral palsy, developmental or intellectual disability, Alzheimer's, blind, deaf, mental/emotional condition), 
* having a mental or emotional condition that seriously interfered with everyday activities (depression, anxiety, trouble getting along with others, trouble concentrating, trouble coping with stress).


They define three domains of disability:
* communication domain: 
Problems realted to seeing, hearing or having their speech understood.
* physical domain:
Problems with one or more functional activities.
* mental domain:
Either a specified condition or any other mental or emotional condition that seriously interfered with everyday acitvities (both ADL and iADL).

Story et al. (1998) categorize human functions or abilities into 8 groups:
* cognition including impairments related to literacy, reasoning, language or cultural prophiciency, memory, attention, comprehension, concentration, etc.,
* vision including impairments related to blindness, hereditary loss of vision, cataracts, glaucoma, retinitis, presbyopia (farsightedness after middle age), macular degeneration, eye injuries, etc.,
* hearing and speech inclduing impairments related to 
* body function including impairments related to 
* arm function including impairments related to 
* hand function including impairments related to , and 
* mobility including impairments related to
