The three-pass approach:  
* The first pass: The bird's eye view (Schmidl).
Read the abstract, title, introduction and conclusions as a whole and ignore any details (math equations, etc.).
* The second pass: Grasp the content (Schmidl).
Read the paper in its entirety and make some notes about the key points in the margins. Ignore some of the details.
* The third pass: Virtually re-implement the paper (Schmidl).
Read the complete paper with all of its details and try to recreate the results.
