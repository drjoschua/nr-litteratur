# How to read scientific papers

The three-pass approach:  
* The first pass: The bird's eye view (Schmidl).
Read the abstract, title, introduction and conclusions as a whole and ignore any details (math equations, etc.).
* The second pass: Grasp the content (Schmidl).
Read the paper in its entirety and make some notes about the key points in the margins. Ignore some of the details.
* The third pass: Virtually re-implement the paper (Schmidl).
Read the complete paper with all of its details and try to recreate the results.

# How to color code with highlighters

## The level of importance method
* Thick yellow for main ideas.
* Green for "second level ideas".
* Pink for "third level ideas".
* Blue for interesting ideas that can easily be skipped.

## The functional method
* Blue: general / background
* Green: objective / goals / hypothesis
* Red: importance / knowledge gaps
* Purple: findings / conclusions
* Orange: method summary

## The Yoshi method
With inspirations from the previous methods.
1. Main tier:
  * ![#ffee1f](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f4e61f/000000?text=+) __main points__: If I only remembered _one thing_ ...
  * ![#ff2127](https://via.placeholder.com/15/dd434b/000000?text=+) __conclusions__: _Something new_ they discovered or proposed.
2. Supporting tier:
  * ![#174445](https://via.placeholder.com/15/174445/000000?text=+) __motivation, background, definitions__: _Where we come from._ The starting point. Very general, more common information.
  * ![#2259bc](https://via.placeholder.com/15/2259bc/000000?text=+) __examples, challenges, obstacles__: _Where we are._ Information that is more specific to the study and newer research.
  * ![#88439c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/88439c/000000?text=+) __methods/means, implementations, results__: _Where we want to go. Where we have come to._ New information and future ideas. The (temporary) ending point.
3. Optional tier:
  * ![#f96730](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f96730/000000?text=+) interesting __litterature__
