## General

[Skjerve et al. (2016)](skjerve-et-al-2016-an-intersectional-persepective-on-web-ccessibility) analyze the social aspects of universal design on people experiencing multiple forms of discrimination.

## Skjerve et al. (2016) An Intersectional Persepective on web Accessibility

Skjerve et al. (2016) investigate social barriers that might limit the participation of people with disabilities by analyzing use and experience of people with multiple forms of discrimination (gender, ability, race).
They discover that marginalized groups emphasize and appreciate the social aspects of the web and the freedom on non-disclosure, at the same time they report to encounter and expect oppressive content online (especially in the comment sections as `house of horror`), and mention reactions (self-exclusion, short lived irritaiton) coping strategies when being confronted with oppresive content (leaving the page, avoiding pages, etc.).
They point out that some of the coping strategies contain elements of victim blaming ("you should have known better", "what did you expect?"), and show how offensive content can limit access to parts of the web that are of public interest.
They make an argument for encouraging developers to consider possible content and finding alternative ways to represent comments while no infringing on the right to free speech.
